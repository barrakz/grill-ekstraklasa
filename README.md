# 🔥 Grill Ekstraklasa

**Grill Ekstraklasa** is a full-stack web application where football fans can **rate, roast, and discuss** players from the Polish Ekstraklasa league. The project was built to demonstrate **real-world software architecture**, full-stack engineering skills, and deployment to production-ready environments.

## 🧑‍💻 Built with Purpose

This project was created from scratch to showcase my abilities as a full-stack developer, including backend API design, frontend development, DevOps, cloud integration, and production deployment. It mimics real-world requirements with authentication, media storage, dynamic content, and infrastructure automation.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

- ✅ End-to-end stack: Django + DRF + Next.js + TypeScript
- ✅ RESTful API with real authentication and permissions
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS EC2
- ✅ Image storage integration with AWS S3
- ✅ API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- ✅ Fully responsive, mobile-first UI
- ✅ Search, filtering, and optimized database indexing
